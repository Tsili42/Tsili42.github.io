## About me

Hi! My name is Nikos Tsilivis and I am from Athens, Greece. I did my undergraduate studies in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (NTUA), where I mostly enjoyed courses on Probability, Control Theory, Machine Learning and Computability. I also spent a wonderful semester in Stockholm, studying Pattern Recognition, Queueing Theory and Databases at KTH as an exchange student. My academical interests lie in the intersection of optimization, learning theory and theory of computation.
