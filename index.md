## About me

Hi! My name is Nikos Tsilivis and I am from Athens, Greece. I did my undergraduate studies in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (NTUA), where I enjoyed courses on Theoretical Computer Science, Applied Math, Control Theory, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My ongoing thesis is supervised by Prof. Petros Maragos and is about Sparse Representations in Tropical Mathematics. I also spent a wonderful semester in Stockholm, studying Pattern Recognition and Queuing Theory at KTH as an exchange student. My academical interests lie in the intersection of optimization and learning theory. I aspire to understand through my research why, how and when models learn.
