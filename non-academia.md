## Films

I like watching them. My favourite directors are, probably, Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick.

## Football

I enjoy playing it. I think it captures the joy of life. Camus once said: “After many years in which the world has afforded me many experiences, what I know most surely in the long run about morality and obligations, I owe to football.”

## Photography

I try to produce interesting ones. I absolutely adore the photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Roy DeCarava and Elliot Erwitt. I am reluctant to share my work, since I am still an amateur, but, if you insist, [here](https://flic.kr/ps/2pQbj9) you go.
