## Films

I like watching them. My favourite directors are, probably, Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick.

## Football

I enjoy playing it. I think it captures the joy of life. Camus once said: “After many years in which the world has afforded me many experiences, what I know most surely in the long run about morality and obligations, I owe to football.”

## Photography

I try to produce interesting ones. I absolutely adore the photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Roy DeCarava and Elliot Erwitt. I am reluctant to share my work, since I am still an amateur, but, if you insist, [here](https://flic.kr/ps/2pQbj9) you go.

*“Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don't think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn't stop you from doing anything at all.”*

― Richard P. Feynman
