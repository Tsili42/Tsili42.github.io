## Films

I like watching them. My favorite directors are Ingmar Bergman, Woody Allen and Stanley Kubrick. If I find the time, I might add reviews about a few of them.

## Football

I enjoy playing it. I think it captures the joy of life. Camus once said: “After many years in which the world has afforded me many experiences, what I know most surely in the long run about morality and obligations, I owe to football.”

## Photography

I try to produce interesting ones. I absolutely adore the photographs of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Roy DeCarava and Elliot Erwitt. I am reluctant to share my work, since I am still an amateur, but if you insist you can find a few of my favorites [here](https://flic.kr/2pQbj9).
