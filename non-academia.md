## Films

I like watching them.

## Football

I enjoy playing it. Camus once said: “After many years in which the world has afforded me many experiences, what I know most surely in the long run about morality and obligations, I owe to football.”

## Photography

I try to produce good ones. I love DeCarava's fine art photography. Explore his artwork today.
